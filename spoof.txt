<Fleckenstein>: hi
The administrator of this server is Server.
<Lenin>: hi
<Lenin>: what are you up to? :)
<Fleckenstein>: i'm building a base
<Lenin>: cool
<Lenin>: i hope it's a bit from spawn :)
<Lenin>: so griefer doesn't find it
<Fleckenstein>: yes
<Lenin>: nice
<Lenin>: there used to a nice base made of glass near spawn, it is griefed now
<Lenin>: (i did not do it btw)
<Fleckenstein>: no one would dare to grief me...
<Lenin>: :)
<Fleckenstein>: as i am the hacker with the most op hacks ever seen on the server
<Fleckenstein>: like fly, noclip, xray...
<Lenin>: what have you got?
<Lenin>: nice
<Lenin>: made it yourself? or downloaded?
<Fleckenstein>: myself
<Fleckenstein>: in C++
<Lenin>: cool
<Lenin>: luckly minetest doesnt have many clients to download :)
<Lenin>: its good for other servers
<Fleckenstein>: yes
<Lenin>: there is only one other player who has hacks that i know of here
<Lenin>: but maybe there are more, but hiding it :)
<Lenin>: still i think most people dont have hacks
<Lenin>: maybe i should learn some C++ :)
<Fleckenstein>: which OS do you use?
<Lenin>: linux
<Fleckenstein>: good :)
<Lenin>: or GNU/linux as stallman would say :D
<Fleckenstein>: :-)
<Lenin>: this server has character :) the spawn looks unique
<Fleckenstein>: are you the one that made the signs at spawn about the red army?
<Lenin>: yes
<Lenin>: i think one thousand blocks is enough to build a base

<Fleckenstein>: you wanna see my base
<DerLombiiie>: yeds
<mrFrieg>: cool
<Fleckenstein>: can u give me the coords of the ender portal? i just lost my last ender eye
<mrFrieg>: There used to be an end portal in spawn, before they generated naturally
(T@mcl_death_messages)FDerLombiiieE was killed by an enderman.E
<mrFrieg>: I've also griefed a bunch of end portals :) but if you get lucky it is working
<mrFrieg>: I've also lost the coords
<Fleckenstein>: Wanna make a faction?
<DerLombiiie>: jes
<DerLombiiie>: *yes
<mrFrieg>: not sure
<Fleckenstein>: did you code your hacks yourself?
<Fleckenstein>: i didw
<mrFrieg>: yeah
<Fleckenstein>: so how did you the fly thing? i edited Client::checkLocalPrivilege
<DerLombiiie>: can i have your cords flec?
<Fleckenstein>: yea on e sec
<Fleckenstein>: oh i found a nice base
<mrFrieg>: wjp os ot
<mrFrieg>: who is it?
<Fleckenstein>: idk
<mrFrieg>: is it a hole in the ground?
<mrFrieg>: with trapdoor?
<Fleckenstein>: yes
<Fleckenstein>: yours?
<mrFrieg>: no
<mrFrieg>: found it
<mrFrieg>: You should turn around, I've griefed that end portal :p I won't work, if that is what you are looking for
<mrFrieg>: it*
<Fleckenstein>: how can an end portal be griefed?
<mrFrieg>: I've found a trick :)
<Fleckenstein>: i guess your hacks are even better than mine
<Fleckenstein>: i have xray, fullbright, fly/fast/noclip and no fall damage
<DerLombiiie>: #report (c@#55ff55)Fleckenstein(c@#ffffff)
<DerLombiiie>: xD
<Fleckenstein>: but i get damage when i use noclip
<Fleckenstein>: This is an anarchy server DerLombiiie
<Fleckenstein>: wait
<Fleckenstein>: the client can send block to the server
<Fleckenstein>: so i could basically send the server any blocks
<Fleckenstein>: **nodes i mean
<Fleckenstein>: thats how to remove unbreakable nodes
<Fleckenstein>: now i just have to implement it
<mrFrieg>: I don't want to reveal the trick :) Don't want it to get patched, so I can't say yes or no
<Fleckenstein>: yea i want to do it myself
<Fleckenstein>: dont tell me the trick
<Fleckenstein>: do u know the base with the jungle tree pillars?
<mrFrieg>: yeah
<mrFrieg>: have no idea who it is
<mrFrieg>: was there before I joined the server
<Fleckenstein>: LOL
<Fleckenstein>: ungriefed base
<Fleckenstein>: 300 blocks from spawn
<Fleckenstein>: on the surface
<mrFrieg>: yeah lol
<mrFrieg>: never thought of it that way
<mrFrieg>: I don't grief, unless I don't like the person
<Fleckenstein>: oh
<Fleckenstein>: now i found a chest with end stuff
<Fleckenstein>: probably yours
<mrFrieg>: how much?
<Fleckenstein>: 5 stacks end stone , 4 stacks chorus fruiut
<mrFrieg>: Because that person played before me he got some stuff from end
<mrFrieg>: very rare
<mrFrieg>: my chest had 1728 end stone though :p
<Fleckenstein>: can i take it?
<mrFrieg>: it is not mine
<mrFrieg>: take it
To DerLombiiie: -100 -400
<Fleckenstein>: is 500 block from spawn enough for base?
<mrFrieg>: I personally think so if you build underground
<mrFrieg>: atleast for now
<mrFrieg>: there are not many players here
<Fleckenstein>: but there are people with xray
<Fleckenstein>: at least me, you and another player
<mrFrieg>: yeah, but if you build like at bedrock layer those won't show unless you dig down
<mrFrieg>: as chunks are cubes
<Fleckenstein>: right
<Fleckenstein>: can you teach me how to use keybindings?
<mrFrieg>: keybindings?
<Fleckenstein>: like press x to activate xray
<mrFrieg>: I don't have that
<Fleckenstein>: i alway have to disconnect to switch it on/off
<mrFrieg>: i have chat commands, like .xr to activate x-ray
<mrFrieg>: so I added code where chat command is sent to check if it starts with dot and switch global variables to toggle stuff
(T@mcl_death_messages)FDerLombiiieE was shot by an arrow from a skeleton.E
<Fleckenstein>: do you use lua or c++ ?
<mrFrieg>: c++
<Fleckenstein>: me too
<Fleckenstein>: i think lua can not be used for cheats
<mrFrieg>: I havent tried :)
<mrFrieg>: but that is probably true

<mrFrieg>: cutting trees
<repu>: nice
<mrFrieg>: what you up to?
<repu>: walking to world border
<mrFrieg>: cool
<mrFrieg>: following the roads?
<repu>: well road ended
<repu>: so on my own
<mrFrieg>: lol
<mrFrieg>: dankmemer said he built to world border x)

<mrFrieg>: oak wood is the best wood
<DerLombiiie>: no dark oak best
<repu>: yep
<mrFrieg>: why would dark oak be better?
<mrFrieg>: oak wood is perfect
<DerLombiiie>: looks nicer
<mrFrieg>: hmm
<mrFrieg>: haven't seen it actually
<repu>: wtf server is lagging
<mrFrieg>: someone lavacast?
<DerLombiiie>: ???
<repu>: idk
<repu>: holy fuk 2 poisonous spiders spawners
<repu>: *sweats*
<mrFrieg>: lol
<repu>: also is anticheat disabled still?
<mrFrieg>: there is no anti-cheat
<Fleckenstein>: there is
<mrFrieg>: except for the movement restrictionk so you can't just teleport everywhere
<Fleckenstein>: yea
<mrFrieg>: or fly around at 1000x
<mrFrieg>: there was real anti-cheat a couple of weeks ago but it crashed server reguarly, and gave falso positive sometimes
<mrFrieg>: so might come back some day when it works better
<repu>: lol yeah i ask about that one
<repu>: i can't wait for next mineclone release
<mrFrieg>: why?
<mrFrieg>: something special coming?
<repu>: lava casting might be fixed so that i can make big castle
<repu>: i filed an issue
<Fleckenstein>: maybe they finally make enchanting possible
<repu>: i'm tired of just
<repu>: piramids that aren't hollow on inside
<mrFrieg>: real lavacast gives hollow structres?
<repu>: yes
<mrFrieg>: cpp;
<mrFrieg>: cool*
<mrFrieg>: I thought they were solid, but it makes sense now when I think about it
<mrFrieg>: but that is confirmed to change?
<mrFrieg>: in mineclone?

<repu>: i know i wanted to loot chest from spawner
<repu>: some skeletons somehow killed themselves when shot into wall
<repu>: but i assume the issue of them shooting through walls wasn't completely fixed
<repu>: maybe i should do another cast

<Fleckenstein>: do you have an end portal?
<Fleckenstein>: i need shulker boxes
<Fleckenstein>: i found a portal but it was destroyed
<repu>: mrFrieg destroyed all end portals
<Fleckenstein>: why?
<repu>: well because
<Fleckenstein>: i'll ask him
<repu>: they have now all the endstone and shulker boxes on server
<Fleckenstein>: ok
<Fleckenstein>: i'll try to fly to end
<repu>: i think there might be other way to get there
<repu>: but for now i haven't found it
<Fleckenstein>: let's try to find it together
<repu>: if you have any idea then you cn share
<Fleckenstein>: he ultimate thing would a teleport exploit, but i dont think that will happen
<Fleckenstein>: i forget the be
<Fleckenstein>: the thing would BE a teleport exploit
<Fleckenstein>: to be or no to be that is the question
<repu>: if you find it
<Fleckenstein>: how many natural portals existst(ed) ?
<Fleckenstein>: that is important for the idea i have
<repu>: idk
<Fleckenstein>: i think its 3 in Minecraft
<repu>: it was far more here
<Fleckenstein>: the question is now wether mrFrieg has griefed all of them
<repu>: well map should be ~30kx30k
<Fleckenstein>: 31k
<repu>: i think i've seen him grief at least 7 or so
<Fleckenstein>: can you give me coords of a griefed one?
<Fleckenstein>: i'd like to have a look at it
<Fleckenstein>: i used ender eye but i did not find where the portal used to be
<repu>: look
<repu>: i am not hacking
<repu>: i have no idea where they are
<Fleckenstein>: u want a client?
<repu>: no
<Fleckenstein>: i did mine on my own
<repu>: i will consider making one myself when this server becomes hardcore pvp
<repu>: for now i don't see a reason
<repu>: so yeah
<Fleckenstein>: there should be a portal around x=-1014 z=-331
<repu>: your best shot is starting to find them from each corner of map by throwing eyes
<Fleckenstein>: i'll try to restore one
<Fleckenstein>: by sending faked nodes to the server
<Fleckenstein>: but idk if that will work i think not
<repu>: you might give it a shot
<repu>: but don't tell mrFrieg
<repu>: because obviously it will get destroyed again
<Fleckenstein>: thats a big problem of mine
<Fleckenstein>: i trust anyone
<repu>: just don't mention it
<repu>: forget about it fter you get all the shulkers that you might need
<Fleckenstein>: my idea is: when the connection times out, you can still build, so building may be managed by client
<Fleckenstein>: if so, i can do anything
<Fleckenstein>: also like place a diablock
<repu>: hmm
<repu>: it may be worth a try
<repu>: there is also an idea
<repu>: i think end is below real world so it is possible to get there by throwing glitching ender pearl into bedrock
<repu>: but there are two problems
<Fleckenstein>: that is not my problem
<Fleckenstein>: i have noclip
<repu>: 1st is there is damage area that doesn't allow moving between
<repu>: dimensions
<repu>: 2nd need to land somehow
<repu>: and survive
<Fleckenstein>: that is not my problem either i have fly
<repu>: i tried doing it but i can't survive the fll through damage area
<Fleckenstein>: i you use noclip you get damage, but glitching through a bedrock layer is not a problem
<repu>: well glitching through bedrock is not problem for me either and landing too slimeblock can be used if placed fast enough
<Fleckenstein>: and i think end is up
<Fleckenstein>: over the overworld
<Fleckenstein>: gonna test that out
<repu>: can you try flying there?
<Fleckenstein>: it takes too long
<repu>: i think there is damage area too
<Fleckenstein>: but i will maybe make a afk redstone machine that does it
<Fleckenstein>: damage area = no problem

orld
<repu>: it's faster to confirm
<Fleckenstein>: no i'll try it out in a singleplayer world
<repu>: okay hope it works out
<Fleckenstein>: end is under the overworld
<Fleckenstein>: 100, 27000, 0
<repu>: yep as i've told
<Fleckenstein>: in minecraft the dimensions have numbers, nether is -1, overworld 0 and end 1, so i thought end might be over the overworld
<repu>: well mineclone is quite different (for now)
<repu>: i think dimensions might get revorked soon
<repu>: reworked
<Fleckenstein>: they could make it so that in the end there is actually an enderdragon
<Fleckenstein>: bwt can wither be spawned?
<Fleckenstein>: **btw
<repu>: not yet
<Fleckenstein>: but why?
<repu>: if it could i would farm wither skeletons by now and spawn wouldn't looks so peacefull
<Fleckenstein>: the enderdragon works, the wither works, but they can not be used!
<repu>: wait thre is ender dragon?
<repu>: wtf
<Fleckenstein>: yes, but there is no ender dragon in end
<repu>: i swear to god i cou;dn't spawn wither in singleplayer
<repu>: when did it change
<Fleckenstein>: you can spawn wither and enderdragon in creative mode
<repu>: is is like mod from git?
<repu>: or from the content menu
<Fleckenstein>: idk

<Fleckenstein>: there is no way to avoid anticheat moved_too_fast yet, right?w
<mrFrieg>: nope
<mrFrieg>: or not that I know of
<Fleckenstein>: can you place nodes?
<Fleckenstein>: i mean cheated
<Fleckenstein>: like place a diablock?
<mrFrieg>: I would be suprised if that is possible
<Fleckenstein>: well, if you can remove nodes
<mrFrieg>: because the node place is dependent on the item you use it with
<Fleckenstein>: ok
<Fleckenstein>: is there an dupe glitch yet?
<mrFrieg>: not that I know of
<mrFrieg>: it is what the server needs :)
<Fleckenstein>: yea
<Fleckenstein>: i disabled Client::sendDamage, this way i dont get fall damage
<Fleckenstein>: do u have that one, too?
<mrFrieg>: yes
<Fleckenstein>: nice
<mrFrieg>: that is just so stupid, that the server completely  trust client to report fall damage
<Fleckenstein>: but fall damage is not really a problem when you have fly
<Fleckenstein>: but it's nice to have
<mrFrieg>: yeah
<mrFrieg>: I once did the mistake of logging out in air with my hacked client and logging on with unhacked client and dying from fall dmg :)

<Fleckenstein>: well that was interesting
<mrFrieg>: you can make it so you never die, they you will become a ghost
<mrFrieg>: you can walk around but not interact
<Fleckenstein>: thats what i did
<Fleckenstein>: but i didn't think i can chat
<Fleckenstein>: btw the ghost mode is the only part of my client that is lua
<mrFrieg>: I got "but why can i chat while dead??" and "hm no, did not work"
<Fleckenstein>: yes
<Fleckenstein>: Foxy02 is me
<Fleckenstein>: can you tell me in which file to do the thing with the . commands? Since this has not really something to do with hacking.

Music volume set to 1. Change will take effect when the next song starts.
<Fleckenstein>: is it just chat.cpp ?
<mrFrieg>: what?
<Fleckenstein>: in which file did you add your commands?
<mrFrieg>: client/client.cpp I think
<Fleckenstein>: ok thanks
<mrFrieg>: there should be somewhere there where chat commands are handled, i put it there and it worked
<Fleckenstein>: ok thanks
<mrFrieg>: the xray does not work very well though (for me) as it will not affect the chunks which already have their meshes computed
<mrFrieg>: so you need to punch already loaded chunks for xray to start on them
<mrFrieg>: but I think that can be solved in some way
<Fleckenstein>: my xray is in ContentFeatures::updateTextures
<mrFrieg>: interesting
<mrFrieg>: I think that is a better way to do it
<Fleckenstein>: if one of the tiles is g_settings->getBool("xray_texture"), the drawtype will be set to NDT_AIRLIKE
<mrFrieg>: aha
<mrFrieg>: I swapped stone with glass in the mesher :)
<Fleckenstein>: :)
<Fleckenstein>: why not swap stone and "ignore"
<Fleckenstein>: because ignore is like air
<mrFrieg>: didn't think much of tbh
<mrFrieg>: I think it is nice to see the outlines of nodes like glass though
<Fleckenstein>: yes, you are right
<Fleckenstein>: i will change that
<Fleckenstein>: i currently have to activate fullbright for xray to work
<mrFrieg>: me too

<mrFrieg>: why?
<Fleckenstein>: because i went to the end
<mrFrieg>: you figured it out? :)
<Fleckenstein>: teleport down
<mrFrieg>: nice :)
<mrFrieg>: then we are two people with that knowledge :
<mrFrieg>: :)
<Fleckenstein>: i told derlombiiie of it
<mrFrieg>: 3 people :)
<Fleckenstein>: but he has no hackclient
<Fleckenstein>: he's on windows, so compiling gets a bit difficult
<mrFrieg>: okey
<Fleckenstein>: i use nether to get back
<mrFrieg>: me too
<mrFrieg>: it all works together nicely :)
<mrFrieg>: wouldn't be possible if end was below nether
<mrFrieg>: just please don't touch my signs in the end :) and please leave your own
<Fleckenstein>: yes i did
<mrFrieg>: also no telling how long that remains, seems like something which could be fixed in the future :) so better get those shulkers now :p
<Fleckenstein>: yes, me too
<mrFrieg>: do you know why boats are so powerful?
<Fleckenstein>: they are the fastest way to travel
<mrFrieg>: but are any exploits? I've tried many things yesterday but none seem to work
<mrFrieg>: hackerman says so on discord
<Fleckenstein>: but didnt he explain it with the guardians?
<mrFrieg>: or seems to hint at it
<mrFrieg>: maybe I just misunderstood
<mrFrieg>: he said it is something epic hackers know :p
<mrFrieg>: also, I think it is possible to create a staircase from the nether up to the end
<Fleckenstein>: no
<mrFrieg>: it is
<Fleckenstein>: there is a damage area
<mrFrieg>: remember what you learnt about trees? :)
<Fleckenstein>: uhm yea
<mrFrieg>: they removing void blocks, so you can build in their place
<Fleckenstein>: void blocks???
<mrFrieg>: yes, the block which causes damage
<Fleckenstein>: that is really not well done
<mrFrieg>: would be really cool if one has the patience to grow trees for 2 thousand blocks :p

<mrFrieg>: btw, what does it mean to create a faction?
<Fleckenstein>: faction is a team
<Fleckenstein>: create a faction = found a team
<Fleckenstein>: did you notice that the "Yellow Shulkerbox" is green?
<mrFrieg>: lol
<mrFrieg>: really?
<mrFrieg>: haha
<mrFrieg>: don't have yellow color :p
<mrFrieg>: do you want to create a faction?
<Fleckenstein>: ok sure
<mrFrieg>: okey, as long as you don't think it is cool to grief Papa's house :) and that you don't mind that it was me who built the hammer and sickle at spawn
<mrFrieg>: what do you think? :)
<Fleckenstein>: yea
<mrFrieg>: nice
<mrFrieg>: btw I built the hammer and sickle because there was a nazi player (Rutlan) who wrote racist stuff about jews and hitler in chat, also built a swastika in Papa's house
<Fleckenstein>: omg
<mrFrieg>: so doesn't mean I support Stalin or any of that :)
<Fleckenstein>: there is a player named lenin
<mrFrieg>: Don't think I've been online at the same time
<mrFrieg>: someone added torches to the hammer and sickle after it was built
<mrFrieg>: there is also a player called fellow comrade

<mrFrieg>: they are gone now
<mrFrieg>: what do you think about building a staircase to the end, do you think it is possible?
<mrFrieg>: like planting trees for 2000 blocks
<mrFrieg>: do you think it even would be worth it?
<Fleckenstein>: no of course not
<Fleckenstein>: we can just use our hacks
<mrFrieg>: would be cool though :p
<mrFrieg>: yeah
<mrFrieg>: you are right, probably big waste of time x)

<Fleckenstein>: does anyone of you have hacks?
<shantaram>: not me
<shantaram>: should we?
<BogArt>: I dont
<Fleckenstein>: yea hacks are really useful on this server
<jonssons>: see
<jonssons>: I knew it
<Fleckenstein>: there is no way to get to the end without hacks
<shantaram>: what client do you recommend then lol
<Fleckenstein>: self-written
<shantaram>: i figured as much
<BogArt>: No way to get to the End?
<Fleckenstein>: i can
<Fleckenstein>: mrFrieg can
<BogArt>: I was going there
<Fleckenstein>: no one else
<BogArt>: I think you gave me the coords
<shantaram>: maybe its time to write a minetest client in js
<jonssons>: lft
<Fleckenstein>: NO?
<Fleckenstein>: you cant write an JavaScript MT client!!!
<shantaram>: whynt
<BogArt>: Maybe it was someone else
<Fleckenstein>: just download the source of minetest and edit some files
<shantaram>: but it's C++Sssssss
<Fleckenstein>: Yea, whats the problem?
<shantaram>: i suck at C++?
<Fleckenstein>: oh
<jonssons>: he's a bit simple ...
<Fleckenstein>: try C first
<Fleckenstein>: thats how i did it
<shantaram>: i did the first chapter of K&R lol
<Fleckenstein>: you're cool
<Fleckenstein>: just keep trying
<shantaram>: yeah maybe it's time to learn C++
<shantaram>: certainly be useful for college
<jonssons>: e=what
<jonssons>: I keep telling you for years
<shantaram>: no you didnt what
<jonssons>: suddenly a stranger comes along telling you to learn c++ and here you are
<shantaram>: i thought you didn't mind that i wrote JS
<Fleckenstein>: JavaScript is a great language
<jonssons>: you know everybody hates js
<shantaram>: i did learn bash after drawing inspiration from you yk
<shantaram>: jonssons: only because that's the cool thing to do
<shantaram>: *quote-unquote cool
<Fleckenstein>: but it is not suitable for some things
<Fleckenstein>: and it is always an advantage to know multible coding languages
<Fleckenstein>: i know like 8
<shantaram>: i can do java too
<Fleckenstein>: lua?
<Fleckenstein>: python?
<shantaram>: yes and yes
<Fleckenstein>: nice
<Fleckenstein>: assembly?
<shantaram>: no lol
<Fleckenstein>: php?
<shantaram>: yeah
(T@mcl_death_messages)FshantaramE was shot by an arrow from a skeleton.E
<jonssons>: finally some trees
<shantaram>: php is really nice
<BogArt>: I found someones dirt hut lol
<shantaram>: or rather i like using it

<Fleckenstein>: at least in Minecraft
<Fleckenstein>: what about building an base in the end?
<Fleckenstein>: 99 % of players don't have access
<mrFrieg>: seems cool but what if the travel gets patched
<Fleckenstein>: hm
<mrFrieg>: I have to go now
<mrFrieg>: cya
<Fleckenstein>: bye
<mrFrieg>: but sure, go ahead and build a base :) I just wouldn't store valuable things there
<Fleckenstein>: then we could still build the staircase
